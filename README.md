# Simple Fish Counter

This project is a **real-time fish counting application** that utilizes the **YOLO** object detection model to track and count fish crossing a defined line in a live video feed. The application provides **memory management**, **status reports**, and allows for **real-time fish tracking and counting**.

## Features

- **Real-time fish tracking and counting** using the YOLO model.
- **Memory management**: Automatically cleans up old tracks to prevent memory overload.
- **Status reporting**: Displays current fish count, FPS, and memory usage every 10 minutes.
- **Line configuration**: Draw a counting line in the video to count fish crossing in or out.
- **Customizable tracking**: Supports custom model paths, camera input, and runtime limits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- **OpenCV**: For handling video input/output and drawing operations.
- **Ultralytics YOLO**: For fish detection (use the YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 model).
- **psutil**: For system resource monitoring (memory usage, CPU).
- **numpy**: For handling arrays and numerical operations.

### Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install opencv-python ultralytics psutil numpy
```

## Setup
-**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fish-counter.git
```

## Configuration
The program allows you to draw a counting line interactively in the video feed. The line is used to detect fish crossing in or out. Hereâ€™s what you need to do:

- Line Positioning: The program will guide you through drawing the line. This line should be placed where fish will most likely pass, ensuring no fish is missed and that the line is as far from the fish exit as possible.

- Saved Configurations: You will be prompted to load a previously saved line configuration, or you can choose to draw a new line if you're using the system for the first time.
## Running the Application
```bash
python xxx.py
```
## Example of Output:
-Once the application starts, you will see the following status:
```bash
